# problem 1. Write a Python program to add two numbers.

a = 34
b = 66
print("The Sum of two numbers", a+b)

# Problem 2. Write a Python program to find the remainder when a number 
# is divided by Z(Integer).
c1 = 459  #Last digit of the integer 
c2 = 15
print("The remeneder when a is divded by", c1%c2)


# Problem 3. Check the type of the variable assigned using the input() function.0

d = input("Enter a Number Here")
d = int(d)   # This convert class of string to integer 
print(d)
print(type(d))

# Problem 4. Use a comparison operator to find out whether a 
# given variable a is greater than b or not. (Take a=34 and b=80)

e = 45
e1 = 46
print(e==e1)
print(e>=e1)
print(e<=e1)

# Problem 5. Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user.

f = input("Enter Fisrst Number ")
f1 = input("Enter Seconed Number")
f = int(f)
f1 = int(f1)
average= (a+b)/2

# Problem 6. Write a Python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
