#Data Types:

#Primarily there are the following data types in Python:

# Integers - [1,2,4,5,-1,-9,-8]
# Floating point numbers - [2.0,63.33, 73,55, 65,39]
# Strings - ["Vasudev Jaiswal", "Ridhi Jaiswal","Ramji jaiswal"]
# Booleans - [True , False ]
# None - [Nothing]


# Integers - [1,2,4,5,-1,-9,-8]
a1 = 18
print(a1)

# Floating point numbers - [2.0,63.33, 73,55, 65,39]
b1 = 63.66,57.2,56.66
print(b1)

# Strings - ["Vasudev Jaiswal", "Ridhi Jaiswal","Ramji jaiswal"]
c1 = ''' "Vaudev Jaiswal " , "Ridhi Jaiswal" , "Ramji Jaiswal" '''
print(c1)

# Booleans - [True , False ]
d1 = True
d2 = False
print(d1,d2)

# None - [Nothing]
e = ""
print(e)

# Printing the type of Variables 
# How to know type of Value 

print(type(a1))      #class<int>
print(type(b1))      #class<float>
print(type(c1))      #class<str>
print(type(d1))      #class<bool>
print(type(e))       #class<str>


# Rules for defining a variable name: (Also applicable to other identifiers)

# A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.

# A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.- Important
_a = "Vasudev"
print(_a)

# A variable canâ€™t start with a digit.
# No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
