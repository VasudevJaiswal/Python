# Python programming tutorial for beginners

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](https://pythondevvasu.tk) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

You can use Python 3.5 or any newer Python with this tutorial. **Don't
use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.**

## List of contents

The tutorial consists of two sections:

### Basics

This section will get you started with using Python and you'll be able
to learn more about whatever you want after studying it.

1. [What is programming?](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
2. [Installing Python](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
3. [Getting started with Python](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
4. [ThinkPython: The way of the program](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
5. [Variables, Booleans and None](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
6. [Using functions](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
7. [Setting up an editor](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
8. [If, else and elif](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
9. [Handy stuff with strings](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
10. [Lists and tuples](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
11. [Loops](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
12. [Trey Hunner: zip and enumerate](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
13. [Dictionaries](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
14. [Defining functions](https://pythondevvasu.tk)

17. [Files](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
18. [Modules](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
19. [Exceptions](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
20. [Classes](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
21. [Docstrings](https://pythondevvasu.tk)

### Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experiment with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

1. [Handy data types](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
2. [Advanced stuff with functions](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
3. [Magic methods](advanced/magicmethods.md)
4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](https://pythondevvasu.tk)
