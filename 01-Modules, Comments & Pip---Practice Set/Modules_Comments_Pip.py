# Modules & Pip

# Modules
# A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) 
# which can be imported and used in our programs.

# Pip
# Pip is a package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your system.

# E.g., pip install flask (It will install flask module in your system)

# Types of modules
# There are two types of modules in Python:

# Built-in modules – Pre-installed in Python
# External modules – Need to install using pip
# Some examples of built-in modules are os, abc, etc.

# Some examples of external modules are TensorFlow, flask, etc.

twotypemoudules = "Built in Modules, External Modules"

a = "os,flask,django,Many more modules"
print(a)
