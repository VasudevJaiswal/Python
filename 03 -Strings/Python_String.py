# What is String ?
# The string is a data type in Python. 
# A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

# We can primarily write a string in three ways: 

'''1. Single quoted strings : a = ‘Vasu’
2. Double quoted strings : b = “Vasudev”
3. Triple quoted strings : c = ‘’’ Vasudev Jaiswal ‘’’ '''

a = 34
b = " 'Vasudev' " # Use this if you have single quotes in your string
c = ' "Vasu" '    
d = ''' "Vasudev
Jaiswal " '''
print(a,b,c,d)
print(type(a))  #This is Type of  <class 'int'>
print(type(b))  #This is Type of <class 'str'> b,c,d are strings
