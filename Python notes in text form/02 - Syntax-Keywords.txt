                    @ Lines and Identation ::
                
# Python doesn't use braces ({ }) to indicate blocks of code for class and function 
definitions or flow control .

Exp :    

         if True:
             print("true")
         else:

@ Multi-Line Statements :: 

# Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python, however, allows the use
of the line  #Continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue/

Exp :    
                 total = item-one +\
                 item-two +\
                 item-three +\
                 item-four 



@ Quotation in Python  :: 

# Python accepts single (') , double (") and triple (''' or ''') quotes to
denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.


 @ Comments in Python ::

# A hash singn (#) that is not inside a string literal is the beginning of a 
Comment 

1. #First Comment
2. print("hello")    #Seconed Comments 
3.  ''' 
       @multi-line Comments
                              '''
