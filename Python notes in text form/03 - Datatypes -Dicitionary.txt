        Python - Variables                                   DataTypes -  Dictionary
#  Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like 
associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. 
A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, 
# but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any 
arbitrary Python object.


# #   Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed 
using square braces ([]). 

For example-

                 dict = {}
                 dict['one'] = "This is one"
                 dict[2] = "This is two"
                 tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}
                 print (dict['one']) # Prints value for 'one' key
                 print (dict[2]) # Prints value for 2 key
                 print (tinydict) # Prints complete dictionary
                 print (tinydict.keys()) # Prints all the keys
                 print (tinydict.values()) # Prints all the values


      Output:-           
                 This is one
                 This is two
                 {'dept': 'sales', 'code': 6734, 'name': 'john'}
                 ['dept', 'code', 'name']
                 ['sales', 6734, 'john']


      Note :-

# Dictionaries have no concept of order among the elements. It is incorrect to say that the 
elements are "out of order"; they are simply unordered.
