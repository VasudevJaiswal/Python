       Chapter -1             Python - Variables Types

# Variables are nothing but Reserved memory locations to #Store Values  .
It means that when we create a variable , We Reserve some space in memory 


        @ Assigning Values to Variables ::

# Python variables do not need explicit declaration to Reserve memory space.
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

   # The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables .

Exp:: 

     1. Counter = 100     #An Integer Assignment 
     2. miles = 1000.23   #An Floating points Assignment
     3. name = "Vasudev"  #An String Assignment
     4. age = 19          #An Integer Assignment

       @ Multiple Assignment ::

# Python allows you to assign a single value to several variable simultaneously.

Exp::   
        1.  a = b = c = 1
          print(b)
Output = 1

        2. a = b =c = 1,2,3,"Vasudev"

        
'''@ standard Data Types  :: '''

# The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example , a person's age is stored
as  a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters .


:- Python has Five standard data Types ==:

1. Numbers Data Types

2. String Data Types

3. List Data Types

4. Tuple Data Types
