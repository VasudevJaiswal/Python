# A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a 
number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within 
parenthesis.
# The main difference between lists and tuples is- Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and 
their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) 
and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. For example-



 Exp :      tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'Vasudev', 70.2 )
            tinytuple = (123, 'Vasudev')
            print (tuple)               # Prints complete tuple
            print (tuple[0])            # Prints first element of the tuple
            print (tuple[1:3])          # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
            print (tuple[2:])           # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
            print (tinytuple * 2)       # Prints tuple two times
            print (tuple + tinytuple)   # Prints concatenated tupl




  Output :- 
                ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'Vasudev', 70.200000000000003)
                abcd
                (786, 2.23)
                (2.23, 'Vasudev', 70.200000000000003)
                (123, 'Vasudev', 123, 'Vasudev')
                ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'Vasudev', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'Vasudev')
