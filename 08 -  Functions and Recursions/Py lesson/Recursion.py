# Recursion
# Recursion is a function which calls itself.

# It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as a function. For example:

# factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
# This function can be defined as follows:

# n! = 1 *2 * 3*4--------*n
n  = 4
product  = 0
for i in range(n):
    product = product * (i+1)
    print(product)
