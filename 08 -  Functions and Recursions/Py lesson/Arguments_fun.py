# Functions with arguments

''' A function can accept some values it can work with. 
 We can put these values in the parenthesis. A function can also return values as shown below: '''

 def greet(name):
	gr = “Hello” + name
	return gr


a = greet(“Vasudev”) #“Vasudev” is passed to greet in name

# a will now contain “Hello Harry”
