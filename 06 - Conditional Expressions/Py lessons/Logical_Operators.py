# Logical Operators
# In python, logical operators operate on conditional statements. Example:



# and -> true if both operands are true else false

age = int(input("Enter your age "))
if age>34 and age>65:
    print("You can work with us")
else:
    print("you can't work with us")


# or -> true if at least one operand is true else false

a = int(input("Enter your number: "))
if a>18 or a=<100:
    print("You are human")
else:
    print("You are Dano")



# not -> inverts true to false and false to true

a = int(input("Enter your number: "))
if a>18 not a=<100:
    print("You are human")
else:
    print("You are Dano")
