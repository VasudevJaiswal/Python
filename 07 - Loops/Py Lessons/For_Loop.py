      # For loop
'''A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like a list, tuple, 
or string (iterables) '''

# The syntax of a for loop looks like this:

l = [1, 7, 8]
for item in l:
	print(item)
# (Above program will print 1, 7, and 8)  ( ek uper ek print honge )

# Write a program to print the content of a list using while loops.'''


# fruits = ['Banana','Watermelon','graps','Mangoes','Apples']
# i = 0
# for item in fruits:
#    print(item)
