    # Range function in Python
'''The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers. '''

# We can also specify the start, stop, and step-size as follows:

#             range(start, stop, step_size)

# step size is usually not used with range()
# An example demonstrating range() function

#Start
for i in range(7):		#range(7) can also be used
	print(i)		#prints 0 to 6

# Stop 
for i in range(1,7):     #range(1.7) can also be used
    print(i)             #Prints 1 to 7 

#Step-size
for i in range(1,8,2):  #range (1,8,2)  # start gap with 2 elements 
    print(i)             # Prints 1,3,5,7
