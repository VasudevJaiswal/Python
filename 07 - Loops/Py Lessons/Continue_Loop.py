# Continue Statements in While Loops 
# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue
#   print(i)




# The continue statement 
''' ‘continue’ is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and 
continue with the next one. It instructs the program to “skip this iteration.” '''

# Example:

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i ==5:
        continue
