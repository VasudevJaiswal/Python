# Chapter 9 â€“ File I/O

# The random access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program terminates.

# In order to persist the data forever, we use files.

''' A file is data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading content
 from it and writing content to it. '''

# Types of Files

# There are 2 types of files:
 
1. Text files (.txt, .c, etc)    #Use Easily Open and Read
2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, etc)    #
